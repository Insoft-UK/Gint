Bugs to fix:
* render:    figure out why fx-CG dclear() now takes 4.1 ms instead of 2.6 ms

Extensions on existing code:
* clock:     mono support
* usb:       add PC->calc reading, and interrupt pipes
* fs:        support RAM files
* fs:        support USB streams as generic file descriptors
* fugue:     support glob() to abstract away BFile entirely
* fugue/fs:  offer a primitive to remove recursively, which is native in Fugue
* bfile:     implement the optimization-restart as realized by Kbd2
* kernel:    better restore to userspace before panic (ensure BL=0 IMASK=0)
* project:   add license file
* kernel:    group linker script symbols in a single header file
* r61524:    brightness control and clean the file
* core:      review forgotten globals and MPU addresses not in <gint/mpu/*.h>
* core:      run destructors when a task-switch results in leaving the app
* fs:        support read-only files backed with GetBlockAddress() on fx-CG
* kernel:    SH4- or G-III-specific linker scripts?
* keysc:     global shortcut SHIFT+0+EXIT for abort() as an infinite loop break

Future directions:
* Audio playback using TSWilliamson's libsnd method
* Serial communication
* Make fx9860g projects work out of the box on fxcg50
* Base for Yatis' threads library
