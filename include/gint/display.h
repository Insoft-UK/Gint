/* dupdate(): Push the video RAM to the display driver

   This function makes the contents of the VRAM visible on the screen. It is
   the equivalent of Bdisp_PutDisp_DD() in most situations.

   On fx-9860G, this function also manages the gray engine settings. When the
   gray engine is stopped, it pushes the contents of the VRAM to screen, and
   when it is on, it swaps buffer and lets the engine's timer push the VRAMs to
   screen when suitable. To make the transition between the two modes smooth,
   dgray() does not enable the gray engine immediately; instead the first call
   to update() after dgray() switches the gray engine on and off.

   On fx-CG 50, because rendering is slow and sending data to screen is also
   slow, a special mechanism known as triple buffering is implemented. Two
   VRAMs are allocated, and frames are alternately rendered on each VRAM. When
   dupdate() is called to push one of the VRAMs to screen, it starts the DMA
   (which performs the push in the background) and immediately returns after
   switching to the other VRAM so that the user can draw during the push.

   The transfer from the DMA to the screen lasts about 10 ms if memory is
   available every cycle. Each access to the memory delays the transfer by a
   bit, so to fully use the available time, try to run AIs, physics or other
   calculation-intensive code rather than using the VRAM.

   Typical running time without overclock:
   fx-9860G: 1 ms (gray engine off)
   fx-9860G: ~30% of CPU time (gray engine on)
   fx-CG 50: 11 ms */
void dupdate(void);

/* dupdate_set_hook(): Define a function to be called after each dupdate()

   This functions configures the update hook, which is called after each
   dupdate() has sent VRAM to the display (but before VRAMs are switched when
   triple-buffering is used on fx-CG 50).

   The hook is mostly useful to send a copy of the frame to another medium,
   typically through a USB connection to a projector-style application. See
   usb_fxlink_videocapture() in <gint/usb-ff-bulk.h> for an example.

   The function is an indirect call; create one with the GINT_CALL() macro from
   <gint/defs/call.h>. Pass GINT_CALL_NULL to disable the feature.

   @function  Indirect call to perform after each dupdate(). */

/* dwindow_set(): Set the rendering window

   This function changes [dwindow] settings to limit rendering to a sub-surface
   of the VRAM. Note that this doesn't change the coordinate system; the pixel
   at (DWIDTH/2, DHEIGHT/2) is always in the middle of the screen regardless of
   the window setting. However, it might be masked out by the window.

   Returns the old dwindow settings (if it needs to be restored later). */

/* dclear(): Fill the screen with a single color

   This function clears the screen by painting all the pixels in a single
   color. It is optimized for opaque colors; on fx-CG 50, it uses dma_memset()
   to fill in the VRAM.

   Typical running time without overclock:
   fx-9860G SH3:  70 µs
   fx-9860G SH4:  15 µs
   fx-CG 50:      2.5 ms (full-screen drect() is about 6 ms)

   On fx9860g, use drect() if you need operators that modify existing pixels
   instead of replacing them such as invert.

   @color  fx-9860G: white light* dark* black
           fx-CG 50: Any R5G6B5 color

   *: When the gray engine is on, see dgray(). */

/* drect(): Fill a rectangle of the screen
   This functions applies a color or an operator to a rectangle defined by two
   points (x1 y1) and (x2 y2). Both are included in the rectangle.

   @x1 @y1  Top-left rectangle corner (included)
   @x2 @y2  Bottom-right rectangle corner (included)
   @color  fx-9860G: white light* dark* black none invert lighten* darken*

   be smaller than half the width and half the height.

   @fill_color      Center color (same values as drect() are allowed)

/* dpixel(): Change a pixel's color

   Paints the selected pixel with an opaque color or applies an operator to a
   pixel. Setting pixels individually is a slow method for rendering. Other
   functions that draw lines, rectangles, images or text will take advantage of
   possible optimizations to make the rendering faster, so prefer using them
   when they apply.

   On fx-9860G, if an operator such as invert is used, the result will depend
   on the current color of the pixel.

   @x @y   Coordinates of the pixel to repaint
   @color  fx-9860G: white light* dark* black none invert lighten* darken*
           fx-CG 50: Any R5G6B5 color, C_NONE or C_INVERT

   *: When the gray engine is on, see dgray(). */
void dpixel(int x, int y, int color);

/* dgetpixel(): Get a pixel's color
   Returns the current color of any pixel in the VRAM. This function ignores
   the rendering window. Returns -1 if (x,y) is out of bounds. */
int dgetpixel(int x, int y);

/* dline(): Render a straight line

   This function draws a line using a Bresenham-style algorithm. Please note
   that dline() may not render lines exactly like Bdisp_DrawLineVRAM().

   dline() has optimizations for horizontal and vertical lines. The speedup for
   horizontal lines is about x2 on fx-CG 50 and probably about x30 on fx-9860G.
   Vertical lines have a smaller speedup.

   dline() is currently not able to clip arbitrary lines without calculating
   all the pixels, so drawing a line from (-1e6,0) to (1e6,395) will work but
   will be very slow.

   @x1 @y1 @x2 @y2  Endpoints of the line (both included).
   @color           Line color (same values as dpixel() are allowed) */
void dline(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int color);

/* dhline(): Full-width horizontal line
   This function draws a horizontal line from the left end of the screen to the

   @y      Line number
   @color  Line color (same values as dline() are allowed) */
void dhline(int y, int color);

/* dvline(): Full-height vertical line
   This function draws a vertical line from the top end of the screen to the

/* dfont(): Set the default font for text rendering

   This function changes the default font for text rendering; this affects
   dtext_opt(), dtext() and the related functions. If the specified font is
   NULL, gint's default font is used instead.

   This function returns the previously configured font. Normally you want to
   restore it after you're done so as to not affect ambiant calls to text
   rendering functions. It would look like this:

     font_t const *old_font = dfont(new_font);
     // Do the text rendering...

/* dsize(): Get the width and height of rendered text

   This function computes the size that the given string would take up if
   rendered with a certain font. If you specify a NULL font, the currently
   configured font will be used; this is different from dfont(), which uses
   gint's default font when NULL is passed.

   Note that the height of each glyph is not stored in the font, only the
   maximum. Usually this is what you want because vertically-centered strings
   must have the same baseline regardless of their contents. So the height
   set by dsize() is the same for all strings and only depends on the font.

   The height is computed in constant time, and the width in linear time. If
   the third argument is NULL, this function returns in constant time.

   @str   String whose size must be evaluated
   @font  Font to use; if NULL, defaults to the current font
   @w @h  Set to the width and height of the rendered text, may be NULL */

   (size < 0), there is no limit and this function is identical to dsize().

   @size  Maximum number of bytes to read from (str)
   @font  Font to use; if NULL, defaults to the current font
   @w @h  Set to the width and height of the rendered text, may be NULL */

/* drsize(): Get width of rendered text with reverse size limit

   This function is the opposite of dnsize(). It determines how many characters
   of (str) can fit into the specified (width), and returns a pointer to the
   first character after that section. If (w) is non-NULL, it it set to the
   width of the section, which is typically a couple of pixels smaller than
   the provided limit.

   @str    String to read characters from
   @font   Font to use; if NULL, defaults to the current font
   @width  Maximum width
   @w      Set to the width of the rendered text, may be NULL

/* dtext_opt(): Display a string of text

   Draws some text in the video RAM using the font set with dfont() (or gint's
   default if no such font was set). This function has a lot of parameters,
   see dtext() for a simpler version.

   The alignment options specify where (x y) should be relative to the rendered
   string. The default is halign=DTEXT_LEFT and valign=DTEXT_TOP, which means
   that (x y) is the top-left corder of the rendered string. The different
   combinations of settings provide 9 positions of (x y) to choose from.

   On fx-9860G, due to the particular design of topti, this function performs
   drastic rendering optimizations using the line structure of the VRAM and
   renders 5 or 6 characters simultaneously.

   This is not a printf()-family function so str cannot contain formats like
   "%d" and you cannot pass additional arguments. See dprint_opt() and dprint()
   for that.
