/* Event transforms

   Every keyboard input device has a built-in event stream editor that can
   transform the events in various ways to change the abstraction details, from
   the raw pollevent() with no transforms to the highest-level getkey().

   Because many transforms like <Instant Modifiers> need to observe the state
   of the keyboard at the time of the event to transform, this process needs to
   be performed right when events are requested and cannot be done later
   without keeping around a lot of information about past states.

   Just as switching from pollevent() to getkey() requires some caution,
   changing the transform settings while keys are pressed or modifiers are
   active minimally impacts the output of the editor. Here is a summary of the
   interactions:

   * <Delete Modifiers> and <Delete Releases> are only concerned about the
     current event and can be turned ON and OFF at any time without problems.

   * <Instant SHIFT> and <Instant ALPHA> only look at the state of the keyboard
     with keydev_keydown() and are not affected by other options.

   * <Delayed SHIFT> and <Delayed ALPHA> only trigger when a SHIFT or ALPHA
     press-release is performed when the keyboard is idle.
     -> If turned ON while a key is pressed, nothing happens until a further
        SHIFT or ALPHA key press while the keyboard is idle.
     -> If turned OFF while (1) a modifier key is being pressed, or (2) a
        modifier key has been pressed and released (charging up the delayed
        modifier), the charge is lost.
     Thus turning delayed modifiers ON->OFF->ON drops the current charge.

   * <Repeats> has the most interactions.
     -> Toggling <Instant SHIFT> or <Instant ALPHA> during a repeat takes
        effect immediately, so a streak can start with instant modifiers
        disabled, enable them mid-flight, and start producing repeating events
        with instant modifiers.
     -> Switching <Delayed SHIFT> or <Delayed ALPHA> during a modified streak
        drops the modifier immediately.
     -> Switching ON any modifier transform breaks a SHIFT or ALPHA streak.
     -> Switching OFF all modifier transforms allows a currently-pressed SHIFT
        or ALPHA key to start a repeat streak, which (due to the way candidates
        for repeats are considered) can only be used to turn a incomplete
        delayed modifier charge or an unused instant modifier into a streak.

   Generally speaking changing options while keys are pressed is safe, but it
   is better to do it while the device is idle for more consistency.

   pollevent() provides the raw events and bypasses the transforms. However,
   the information needed to resume transforming is still tracked when
   generating raw events: for instance, which key is a candidate for repetition
   is still tracked (by contrast, getkey() needs special code to catch up if
   pollevent() unqueued events that it needed). Delayed modifiers are not
   tracked because they can be charged only if the transform is enabled when
   the modifier key is pressed. */

   repeats.

   delay is dependent on the keyboard scan frequency. In the default setting
   (128 Hz scans), the possible repeat delays are approximately 8 ms, 16 ms,
   23 ms, 31 ms. The system default is (500 ms, 125 ms). With the 128 Hz
   setting, this default is reached exactly without approximation. gint's
   default is (400 ms, 40 ms) for more reactivity.

   Note: Due to a current API limitation, every input device uses the delays
   for the physical keyboard.
