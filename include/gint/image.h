// gint:image - Image manipulation and rendering
//
// Note: this module is currently only available on fx-CG.
//
// This header provides image manipulation functions. This mainly consists of a
// reference-based image format, various access and modification functions, and
// a number of high-performance transformations and rendering effects. If you
// find yourself limited by rendering time, note that RAM writing speed is
// often the bottleneck, and image rendering is much faster in Azur (which is
// what the renderer was initially designed for).
//
// This module supports 3 bit depths: full-color 16-bit (RGB565), indexed 8-bit
// (P8) and indexed 4-bit (P4). All three have an "alpha" variation where one
// color is treated as transparent, leading to 6 total formats.
//
// The image renderers support so-called *dynamic effects*, which are image
// transformations performed on-the-fly while rendering, without generating an
// intermediate image. They comprise straightforward transformations that
// achieve similar performance to straight rendering and can be combined to
// some extent, which makes them reliable whenever applicable.
//
// For images of the RGB16 and P8 bit depths, the module supports a rich API
// with image subsurfaces and a fairly large sets of geometric and color
// transforms, including some in-place. P4 is not supported in most of these
// functions because the dense bit packing is both impractical and slower for
// these applications.

/* image_copy(): Convert and copy an image

   This function copies an image into another image while converting certain
   formats. Unlike transforms, this function does clip, so there are no
   conditions on the size of the target.

   If [copy_alpha] is true, transparent pixels are copied verbatim, which
   effectively replaces the top-left corner of [dst] with [src]. If it's false,
   transparent pixels of [src] are skipped, effectively rendering [src] over
   the top-left corner of [src].

   This function converts between all formats except from RGB16 to P8/P4, since
   this requires generating a palette (which is a complex endeavour).
   Conversions from P8/P4 to RGB16 simply decode the palette. Conversions
   between P8/P4 preserve the contents but renumber the palette entries. From
   P4 to P8, the image is always preserved. From P8 to P4, the image is only
   preserved if it has less than 16 colors (this is intended to allow P4 images
   to be converted to P8 for edition by this library, and then back to P4). The
   following table summarizes the conversions:

     Source format →      RGB16           P8                P4
     Target format ↓  +-----------+----------------+------------------+
               RGB16  |    Copy     Decode palette    Decode palette  |
                  P8  |     -            Copy        Enlarge palette  |
                  P4  |     -       Narrow palette         Copy       |
                      +-----------+----------------+------------------+

   Note that conversions to RGB16 are not lossless because RGB565, P8 and P4
   can represent any color; if a color equal to image_alpha(IMAGE_RGB565A) is
   found during conversion, this function transforms it slightly to look
   similar instead of erroneously generating a transparent pixel.

   Formats: RGB16 → RGB16, P8 → Anything, P4 → Anything
   Size requirement: none (clipping is performed)
   Supports in-place: No (useless) */
void image_copy(image_t const *src, image_t *dst, bool copy_alpha);

/* image_copy_alloc(): Convert and copy into a new image
   This function is similar to image_copy(), but it allocates a target image of
   the desired format before copying. */
image_t *image_copy_alloc(image_t const *src, int new_format);

/* image_fill(): Fill an image with a single pixel value */
void image_fill(image_t *img, int value);

/* image_clear(): Fill a transparent image with its transparent value */
void image_clear(image_t *img);

//---
// Sub-image extraction
//---

/* image_sub(): Build a reference to a sub-image

   This function is used to create references to sub-images of RGB16 and P8
   images. The [data] pointer of the sub-image points somewhere within the data
   array of the source, and its [palette] pointer is identical to the source's.

   The last parameter is a pointer to a preallocated image_t structure (usually
   on the stack) that gets filled with the data. Doing this instead of
   allocating a new object with malloc() means that there is no need to
   image_free() the sub-image, and thus it can be used inline:

     image_t tmp;
     image_hflip(src, image_sub(dst, x, y, w, h, &tmp));

   A preprocessor macro is used to make the last parameter optional. If it's
   not specified, a pointer to a static image_t will be returned instead. This
   is useful in inline calls as shown above, which then simplify to:

     image_hflip(src, image_sub(dst, x, y, w, h));

   However, another call to image_sub() or image_at() will override the
   sub-image, so you should only use this in such temporary settings. If you
   need multiple image_sub() or image_at() calls in the same statement, only
   one can use the short form.

   If the requested rectangle does not intersect the source, the sub-image will
   be of dimension 0x0. If the image format does not support sub-images (P4),
   the sub-image will test invalid with image_valid(). */
image_t *image_sub(image_t const *src, int x, int y, int w, int h,
    image_t *dst);

/* Make the last parameter optional */
#define image_sub1(src, x, y, w, h, dst, ...) image_sub(src, x, y, w, h, dst)
#define image_sub(...) image_sub(__VA_ARGS__, NULL)

/* image_at(): Build a reference to a position within a sub-image */
#define image_at(img, x, y) image_sub(img, x, y, -1, -1)

//---
// Geometric image transforms
//
// All geometric transforms render to position (0,0) of the target image and
// fail if the target image is not large enough to hold the transformed result
// (unlike the rendering functions which render only the visible portion).
//
// To render at position (x,y) of the target image, use img_at(). For instance:
//   image_hflip(src, image_at(dst, x, y));
//
// Each transform function has an [_alloc] variant which does the same
// transform but allocates the target image on the fly and returns it. Remember
// that allocation can fail, so you need to check whether the returned image is
// valid.
//
// (You can still pass an invalid image to libimg functions when chaining
//  transforms. The invalid image will be ignored or returned unchanged, so you
//  can check for it at the end of any large chain.)
//
// Some functions support in-place transforms. This means they can be called
// with the source as destination, and will transform the image without needing
// new memory. For instance, image_hflip(src, src) flips in-place and replaces
// src with a flipped version of itself.
//
// (However, it is not possible to transform in-place if the source and
//  destination intersect in non-trivial ways. The result will be incorrect.)
//
// When transforming to a new image, transparent pixels are ignored, so if the
// destination already has some data, it will not be erased automatically. Use
// image_clear() beforehand to achieve that effect. This allows alpha blending
// while transforming, which is especially useful on the VRAM.

   of [.effect], and color effect settings. See the effect-specific functions
   to see how they are defined.

   linked in unless an effect is actually used, which avoids blowing up the
   size of the add-in as the number of support dynamic effects increases.

   @img         Source image
   @effects     Set of dynamic effects to be applied, as an [IMAGE_*] bitmask
   @left_edge   Whether to force 2-alignment on the input (box->left)
   @right_edge  Whether to force 2-alignment on the width
   @cmd         Command to be filled
   @window      Rendering window (usually {0, 0, DWIDTH, DHEIGHT})

   case [cmd] is unchanged), true otherwise. [*box] is also updated to reflect
   the final box after clipping but not accounting for edges.  */
