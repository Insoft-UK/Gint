// The following types and functions can be used to create "indirect function
// calls": function calls that are executed several times or a long time after
// they are created. This is useful for callbacks, where you set up a function
// to be called when an event occurs. The function and its argument are kept in
// the call object until the event occurs, at which point the call is realized.

/* GINT_CALL(): Build an indirect call from function and arguments

   This macro builds an indirect call (of type gint_call_t). Indirect calls are
   used in various APIs (timers, RTC, DMA, USB...) to notify the program of
   events that are caused by the hardware instead of the program.

   The calls are often made asynchronously, which means that the function
   setting up the call finishes first, and then the call is made later while
   some other part of the program is running. This is tricky, because in order
   to perform the call:

   * The code and arguments must still exist, even though the function that
     provided them has returned long ago;
   * The call ABI is lost as soon as we store parameters instead of
     syntactically performing a call in the code.

   For the first issue, the caller has to make sure that every pointer that is
   passed to the call will still be valid when the call is made; in particular,
   pointers to variables on the stack can ony be used if the call is guaranteed
   to be made before the function ends (eg. if there is a synchronous wait in
   the function).

   For the second issue, gint's indirect call mechanism guarantees ABI
   compatibility by restricting the arguments that can be passed to the
   callback.

   * Only arguments that fit into registers can be passed. In practice, this
     mostly excludes 64-bit integers, double floating-point values, and custom
     structures. This way, there is a somewhat solid guarantee that the
     callback function will take arguments in r4...r7.
   * Only up to 4 arguments can be passed.
   * Only values of the types listed in gint_call_arg_t can be passed.

   If you need to work around one of these limitations, pass a pointer to a
   structure containing your arguments (if the call is invoked after the
   current function ends, make the structure static or global).

   If you need to pass a char or a short, cast to an int and have the function
   take an int. If you need to pass a pointer to a type not listed in
   gint_call_arg_t (such as a structure), cast it to (void *); the function can
   still take a pointer to the custom type as argument.

   If the conditions for the arguments to work are not met, the compiler will
   emit on of these two errors:

   * error: static assertion failed: "GINT_CALL: too many arguments (maximum
     4)" -> This is emitted if you have more than 4 arguments.
   * error: cast to union type from type not present in union
     -> This is emitted if you pass a parameter of an invalid type. */
