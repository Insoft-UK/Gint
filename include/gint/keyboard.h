/* Keyboard, key events, keydown() and getkey()

   gint's keyboard driver regularly scans the keyboard matrix and produces *key
   events*. A key event basically says that a key has been pressed or released
   at some point in time. Key events are a faithful description of everything
   that happens on the keyboard.

   These key events are stored in the *event queue*, from where they can be
   retrieved:

   * pollevent() fetches the next keyboard event waiting in the queue. Events
     will always be returned in chronological order. If there is no keyboard
     event pending (ie. if nothing happened since last time events were read),
     this function returns a dummy event of type KEYEV_NONE.
   * waitevent() fetches the next keyboard event waiting in the queue. If the
     queue is empty, it waits until one becomes available or a timeout expires,
     whichever comes first. The timeout can be configured.

   When events have been read, other functions can be read to check whether a
   certain key (or set of keys) is pressed.

   * keydown() checks if the specified key is currently pressed. (*)
   * keydown_all() checks if all keys of a specified list are pressed. The list
     should end with value 0.
   * keydown_any() checks if any key of a specified list is pressed. The list
     should end with value 0.

   (*) The keydown() functions do not report the absolute current state of the
       key, but rather the state of the key according to the events that have
       been retrieved so far. If the queue contains {KEY_A, KEYEV_DOWN} and
       {KEY_A, KEYEV_UP}, the following sequence of events will happen:

         keydown(KEY_A)   -> 0
         pollevent()      -> {KEY_A, KEYEV_DOWN}
         keydown(KEY_A)   -> 1
         pollevent()      -> {KEY_A, KEYEV_UP}
         keydown(KEY_A)   -> 0

       Synchronizing keydown() and the events increases the accuracy of
       keyboard information for fast programs and its reliability for slow
       programs.

       When all events have been read from the queue, keydown() returns the
       absolute current key state, which is what will happen 90% of the time.

   Applications that are not interested in event contents but only in pressed
   keys can automatically read all events from the queue before they start
   using keydown():

   * clearevents() reads all pending events from the input queue.

   The previous functions are quite low-level. GUI programs that look like the
   system applications will prefer using a GetKey()-like functions that return
   a single key press at a time, heeds for releases, for SHIFT and ALPHA
   modifiers, handles repeats, backlight and return-to-menu.

   * getkey_opt() is gint's enhanced GetKey()-like function, with support for
     custom repetition and many fine-tunable options.
   * getkey() is a specific call to getkey_opt(), that imitates GetKey().

   These functions introduce a new type of key event called KEYEV_HOLD which
   represents a key repeat. */

/* key_event_t: Low-level or high-level keyboard event

   This structure represents an event that occurs on the keyboard. It is first
   produced by the keyboard scanner with limited information, then possibly
   enriched by getkey(). Events are produced each time the keyboard is scanned,
   which is 128 Hz by default. Hence, a key press and release occuring in less
   than 8 ms might not be detected.

   getkey() returns enriched events with [mod=1], in whic ase [shift] and
   [alpha] indicate whether the key has been modified. Only key press events
   returned by getkey() have [mod=1]. Note that you can't have, e.g.
   [key=KEY_SHIFT] and [mod=1] at the same time.

   The [time] attribute indicates when the event occurred. It is a snapshot of
   a time counter that increases at each keyboard scan and *wraps around every
   8 minutes* (at 128 Hz). I expect this attribute to be useful to analyze
   combo sequences in games. Make sure you are aware of the two nitpicks:
   * Don't keep the time values for too long because of the wrap-around effect.
   * 0xffff is "just before" 0x0000, not "long after". */

   - Controls backlight on models that have a back-lit screen

/* getkey_opt(): Enhanced getkey()

   This function enhances getkey() with more general features. An
   or-combination of option flags (see above) must be supplied as first
   argument; GETKEY_NONE stands for no option. getkey_opt() returns the same
   kind of events as getkey().

   getkey_opt() supports a generic timeout function in the form of a volatile
   pointer [timeout]. If it's NULL, getkey_opt() waits indefinitely. Otherwise,
   it waits until *timeout becomes non-zero. It's up to you to change the
   value whenever you want to interrupt the call; using a timer with
   [timer_timeout] as callback is suitable. See <gint/timer.h>.

   Event transforms in getkey_opt() (SHIFT, ALPHA and repetitions) are handled
   by changing the transform settings on the keyboard device. These settings
   are restored when getkey_opt() returns, so if they are originally disabled
   (which they are unless set manually) then the status of the SHIFT and ALPHA
   keys is lost between calls (this has an effect it getkey_opt() is
   interrupted by timeout). Therefore, in order to use modifiers across several
   calls to getkey_opt(), make sure to enable the transforms on the keyboard
   device; see <gint/drivers/keydev.h> for details.

   @options  An or-combination of values from the GETKEY_* enumeration
   @timeout  Optional pointer to a timeout value
   Returns a key event of type KEYEV_DOWN or KEYEV_HOLD with [mod=1]. */

   The feature function can be used to extend getkey() with application-wide
   shortcuts, in a way similar to the CATALOG, CAPTURE or OFF functions of the
   original getkey(). The feature function can be set globally at the
   application level, and thus does not require every call site that uses
   getkey() to support the shortcuts explicitly.

   The feature function receives events when they are generated; if can them
   process them, and return either true to accept the event (preventing
   getkey() from returning it) or false to refuse the event (in which case it
   is returned normally).

   The feature function is enabled by default and be disabled by removing the
   GETKEY_FEATURES flag in getkey_opt(). Setting function=NULL disables the
   functionality. */
